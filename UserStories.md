# User Stories

## Primary Build User Stories

* Users can view all playlists (index)
* Users can create a playlist (new/create)
* Users can view one playlist (show)
* Users can delete a playlist (destroy)
* Users can edit a playlist (edit/update)

## Secondary Functionalities 

Once we have this single Playlist resource build, we can move onto making an associated Comment resource.

* Users can comment on playlists (comments#create)
* Users can delete comments (comments#destroy)

As we finish and test user stories we'll be committing to github 🐙.
